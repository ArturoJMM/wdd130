            Lima is the capital of Peru, located on the country's arid Pacific coast. Although its colonial center remains, it is a bustling metropolis and one of the largest cities in South America. The Larco Museum houses a collection of pre-Columbian art, and the Museo de la Nación traces the history of Peru's ancient civilizations. The Plaza de Armas and the 16th-century cathedral are the heart of Lima's old center.
