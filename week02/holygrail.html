                Dynasty of the Holy Grail: Mormonism's Sacred Bloodline
            </h2>
            <p>
                What do the Virgin Mary, King Arthur, and Joseph Smith have in
                common? This is one of the questions that Vern Swanson attempts
                to answer in Dynasty of the Holy Grail: Mormonism Sacred Bloodline.
                Swanson, who has been director of the Springville Art Museum in Utah
                since 1980 and who has published extensively in art historical topics,
                applies his skills to a different body of material in this impressive, largeformat volume of over five hundred pages.
